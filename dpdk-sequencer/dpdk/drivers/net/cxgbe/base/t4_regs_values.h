 * T5 and later support a new BAR2-based doorbell mechanism for Egress Queues.

 * (X_IDXSIZE_UNIT) Gather Buffer interface at offset 64.  For Ingress Queues,
 * we have a Going To Sleep register at offsets 8x+4.
 *
 * As noted above, we have many instances of the Simple Doorbell and Going To
 * Sleep registers at offsets 8x and 8x+4, respectively.  We want to use a
 * non-64-byte aligned offset for the Simple Doorbell in order to attempt to
 * avoid buffering of the writes to the Simple Doorbell and we want to use a
 * non-contiguous offset for the Going To Sleep writes in order to avoid
